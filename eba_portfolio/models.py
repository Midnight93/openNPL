Models are core Relations (Tables) of the EBA Portfolio Template
`EBA Templates <https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/EBA_NPL_Template>`_

Each model is implemented in a separate file EBA_TABLE_NAME.py
TODO Missing are the following: the Lease Table and schedule tables (swap cashflows and repayments)

In addition there is a Portfolio model and a Portfolio_Snapshot model
