Functionality
-------------
The openNPL platform will typically be used by a combination of regular users, administrators and developers.

Users can use openNPL to:
* Log-in into the application with their credentials
* Inspect the available data sets (tables or relations) that capture the EBA Template recommendations<
* Insert, Update or Delete records (e.g. new counterparty or loan data)
* Consult the documentation as to the meaning and requirements of each data element


**NB: openNPL is still in active development. Functionality will be significantly enhanced in future versions. If you have specific requests / ideas please raise them in our github repository**

Architecture
------------
The following describes the current architecture

* openNPL is built on top of the Python Django framework
* The non-performing loan template recommendations of the EBA are implemented as distinct models in the database
* Additional models are introduced to bind the data together
* The user interface uses built-in Django forms as those are rendered by the Grappelli skin
* The backend database is currently sqlite
